# Bucić–Chen–Ma (2026): longer odd cycles

Theorem 1.2 of Bucić, Chen, and Ma gives the maximal anti-Ramsey function
for the odd cycle of length `2k + 1`, `k ≥ 4`, throughout the nontrivial edge
range. The `o(n²)` term is recorded as an error bound uniform in the edge
count. Their result implies the threshold asymptotic conjectured by Burr,
Erdős, Graham, and Sós for these cycle lengths.

These are statements of the 2026 preprint's results. The preprint is cited in
`formalization.yaml`, and their proofs are developed in this directory.
The shared leading term is defined in `Erdos809/MainTerm.lean`.
