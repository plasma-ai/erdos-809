# Edges inside a disjoint cleaned neighborhood

When a failed three-edge path has disjoint cleaned neighborhoods, they are
anticomplete and together cover almost all vertices. Minimum degree then
forces almost all of each vertex's neighbors in the first set to remain in
that set. Summing these internal degrees gives the edge bound below.
