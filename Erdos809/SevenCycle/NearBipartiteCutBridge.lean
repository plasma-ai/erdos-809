# Passing a cleaned-cut bound to a maximum cut

The overlap argument bounds the edges internal to a particular cleaned-neighborhood
cut. A maximum cut of the same graph has no more internal edges. This keeps the
near-bipartite error bound when the cut is replaced by one suitable for the
local degree argument.
