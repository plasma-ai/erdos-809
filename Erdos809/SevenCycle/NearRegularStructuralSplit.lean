# The pointwise near-regular structural split

At each graph order, either the robust three-path property holds or its
failure has a witness with at most ten forbidden vertices. The two cleaned
neighborhoods of that witness are disjoint or share a vertex. This is a
pointwise split, so it applies even when the alternatives change with the
graph order.
