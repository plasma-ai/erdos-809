# Colors in the disjoint cleaned-neighborhood case

The first cleaned neighborhood is nearly complete when the two cleaned
neighborhoods are disjoint. If it is large enough for seven-cycle connectors,
its edges must all have different colors. The finite edge count then gives a
lower bound on the full palette.
