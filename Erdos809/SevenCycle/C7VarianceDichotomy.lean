# A variance subsequence dichotomy

A nonnegative variance sequence either has a positive lower bound along an
infinite subsequence, or tends to zero. This suffices to combine lower bounds
proved in the two branches of the seven-cycle argument: any failure of an
eventual bound can first be restricted to an infinite bad subsequence.
