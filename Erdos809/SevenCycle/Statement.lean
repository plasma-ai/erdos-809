# Exact-edge seven-cycle threshold

The seven-cycle branch uses graphs on `Fin n` with exactly `⌊n²/4⌋ + 1`
edges. A cycle is specified by seven distinct vertices in cyclic order, and
its seven edge colors must be pairwise distinct. This exact-edge formulation
is related to the general graph-copy formulation in `Erdos809/Comparison.lean`.
