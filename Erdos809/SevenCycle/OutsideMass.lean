# The outside-mass calculation for Erdős problem 809

These lemmas package the numerical final step of the C7 palette argument.
Here `m` is the mass of the selected joint clique, `u` is the remaining
mass, `c` is the outside edge mass, and `s` is the saving on cut palettes.
The graph-theoretic arguments supply one of the two sets of hypotheses below.

/-- When the outside edge mass is at most `u² / 4`, the universal palette
bound gives the required total saving. -/

/-- In the high outside-density case, the second joint clique gives
`(l-u/2)² ≥ c-u²/4`. The clique palette estimate is supplied in the
division-free form `u*s ≤ m*l*(u-l)`. -/
