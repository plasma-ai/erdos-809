# Finite C7 palette bound

For a finite symmetric support, active unordered edge types have the full
weighted capacity. The conflict graph is defined by the two-walk and
three-walk connectors. Any fractional allocation of compatible palettes
covering those capacities has cost greater than one eighth when the supported
edge mass is greater than one quarter.

/-- The finite palette inequality for the active edge demands of a symmetric
support. Loops have half the unordered capacity, as in `activeDemand`. -/
