# Extracting a large nearly regular induced graph

Small degree variance bounds the number of vertices below a chosen degree
cutoff. Removing those vertices costs each retained vertex at most the number
removed in degree. These finite estimates are the quantitative part of the
variance-zero branch of the C7 argument.
